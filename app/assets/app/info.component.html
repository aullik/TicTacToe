    <h1>TicTacToe 3D</h1>
    3D tic-tac-toe, also known by the trade name <strong> Qubic </strong>, is a board game. It is similar in concept to traditional
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">tic-tac-toe </a> but is played in a cubical array of cells. Players take turns placing their markers in blank cells in the array. The first player to achieve three of their own markers in a row wins.
    The winning row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal on a single board as in regular tic-tac-toe, or vertically in a column, or a diagonal line through four boards.
